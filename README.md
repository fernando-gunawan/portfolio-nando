##  Overview

Welcome to my customized Data Analyst Portfolio. This website is designed not just to list projects, but to provide an immersive experience reflecting the depth and vastness of big data through a "cosmic" visual theme. It serves as a central hub for my professional work, case studies, and technical skills in data analytics.

- **Project Showcase**: specific sections to highlight various data analysis projects (e.g., Ecotech).
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth scrolling, reveal animations, and hover effects for a dynamic user experience.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with the latest web technologies ensuring performance and responsiveness.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes Google's Generative AI features.

##  Technologies Used

- **Core**: [React](https://react.dev/) (v19), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Custom Config), CSS3 Keyframe Animations
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

      ```

4.  **Run Development Server**:
